# Big-endian and  little-endian

Big-endian and  little-endian are the two main ways to represent endianness. Big-endian  keeps the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory  location and the least significant byte at the largest. On the other  hand, little-endian keeps the least significant address at the smallest  memory location.
